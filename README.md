# Product_Recommendation_System
In this project, I developed a text-based recommendation system for products, built on a directed graph structure.
The system models products and categories as nodes, with semantic relationships such as contains, part-of, or successor-of represented as edges.
Recommendations are computed by traversing this graph structure.
